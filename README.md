Solarized - Command Prompt theme
=============================================

This is a [Solarized][1] color scheme for the Windows command prompt,
contributed by Neil Pankey.

See the [Solarized home page][1] for screenshots and more details,
as well as color schemes for other applications. To contribute or file bug
reports or issues, please visit [the GitHub repo for this port][2],
or the main [Solarized repository][3].

Inspired by this [post][4]

Installation
------------

Import the `.reg` file of choice, e.g. `regedit /s solarized-dark.reg`.

Both files contain the same palettes, the only difference is the default
foreground and background colors. Therefore you can switch between themes
on the fly with `color 8C` for dark and `color FB` for light.
